SleepSync AI is a smart digital assistant that predicts how much energy you will have tomorrow based on your body’s current biological data. It tracks three main factors: your "Sleep Debt" from the previous night, the "Caffeine Pulse" still in your system, and your "Metabolic Load" from late-night meals. By calculating how these habits interfere with your deep sleep cycles, the app gives you a personalized efficiency score to help you plan your day.

To get your own version running, you just need to upload your code to GitHub and connect it to Streamlit Community Cloud. Make sure to include a requirements.txt file so the server knows which tools to install. Once deployed, you will have a cinematic, high-tech website that turns complex biology into simple, actionable insights for better performance.
